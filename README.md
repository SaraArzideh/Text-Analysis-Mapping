# Network Analysis of Co-occurrent Terms  🔗

This repository and three previous Text-Analysis toolkits: Data-Preparing, Trends-Over-Time, and Network-Insights repositories, contain a collection of Python scripts developed for textual analysis and concept mining of research data. This repository contains a Python script for analyzing co-occurrent terms and concepts from a dataset. The script processes a CSV file of filtered articles, extracts relevant terms, builds a network graph using NetworkX, and visualizes the clusters. This analysis is particularly useful for understanding term relationships and concept clusters in textual data.

---

##  📜 Features
- **Term Frequency Analysis**: Count frequencies of co-occurrent terms in titles, abstracts, and keywords.
- **Network Building**: Construct a network graph of co-occurrent terms and concepts.
- **Visualization**: Generate a visual representation of the network with clusters.
- **Output Files**: Save term frequencies, network data, and edge weights as CSV files.

## 📂 Files in the Repository
- **`Map.py`**: Main Python script for processing the data, building the network, and visualizing the clusters.
- **Input**: A CSV file (`filtered_articles_subset.csv`) with columns like `Title`, `Abstract`, `Author Keywords`, and `Concepts`.
- **Outputs**:
  - `term_frequencies.csv`: Term frequency counts.
  - `network_graph.gexf`: Network data in GEXF format for further analysis.
  - `network_edges.csv`: Edges and their weights in the network graph.
